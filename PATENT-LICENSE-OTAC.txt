NyxQuantum FRAND-Z Patent License for OTAC 0.1.1  
Version 1.2 — January 2026

IMPORTANT NOTICE  
This document is not legal advice. It is a permissive patent license intended to
facilitate open, royalty-free adoption of the OTAC 0.1.1 specification and
interoperable implementations.

1. DEFINITIONS

“Licensor” means the owner of the patent rights identified with this license,
currently Sigitas Andrijauskas Sumlinskas (acting under the NyxQuantum project /
NQ portfolio), and any successor that explicitly adopts this license.

“Licensee” means any natural or legal person who implements, uses, sells, offers
for sale, imports, or otherwise practices the OTAC 0.1.1 Specification and relies
on this license.

“Affiliate” of a party means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with that party, where “control”
means ownership or control, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent
(50%) of the voting interests of the entity or the power to direct its
management and policies.

“OTAC 0.1.1 Specification” means the technical specification identified as
“OTAC 0.1.1 — Canonical Temporal Attestation Capsule” (including its Required
portions as published by the Licensor) and any normative errata or updates that
Licensor explicitly designates as covered by this license.

“Conforming Implementation” means any implementation, in whole or in part, that
implements all Required features of the OTAC 0.1.1 Specification as published by
Licensor, with only such deviations as are unavoidable due to defects, omissions,
or ambiguities in the specification itself.

“Essential Claims” means those patent claims, now or hereafter owned or
controlled by Licensor, that are necessarily infringed by implementing the
Required portions of the OTAC 0.1.1 Specification in a Conforming Implementation.
Essential Claims do not include (a) claims covering solely implementations of
optional or non-normative features, (b) claims that would be infringed only as a
result of the manufacture or use of enabling technologies, reference
implementations, or other systems not required by the OTAC 0.1.1 Specification,
or (c) any claim that would be infringed only by reason of the combination of a
Conforming Implementation with other hardware or software, where such combination
is not required by the OTAC 0.1.1 Specification.

“Aggressor” means any Licensee (including its Affiliates) that initiates or
maintains a Patent Assertion (as defined below) against Licensor or any other
implementer of OTAC 0.1.1.

“Patent Assertion” means any lawsuit, counterclaim (other than a purely defensive
counterclaim to a prior suit), administrative action, or similar proceeding
alleging that the making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, or other
exploitation of an OTAC 0.1.1 Conforming Implementation infringes one or more
patents.

“Contributor” means any person or entity who submits proposed changes, test
vectors, code, or other material to Licensor for inclusion in the OTAC 0.1.1
Specification or reference artifacts.

2. GRANT OF LICENSE

Subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this license, Licensor
hereby grants to each Licensee a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
non-transferable (except in connection with the transfer of the relevant business
or assets), irrevocable (except as provided in Sections 3 and 4) patent license
under Licensor’s Essential Claims to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale,
import, and otherwise exploit Conforming Implementations of OTAC 0.1.1.

This grant applies only to Essential Claims and only to the extent that such
claims are necessarily infringed by a Conforming Implementation of OTAC 0.1.1.
No rights are granted under any other patents, patent applications, or claims of
Licensor.

3. FRAND-Z RECIPROCITY

This license is conditioned on Licensee and its Affiliates offering, with respect
to their own Essential Claims for OTAC 0.1.1, at least equally favorable terms:
a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, with no upfront or running
monetary royalties (“FRAND-Z” terms), to Licensor and to any other implementer of
a Conforming Implementation.

If a Licensee or its Affiliate refuses to grant such FRAND-Z terms for its
Essential Claims covering OTAC 0.1.1, Licensor may treat such entity as an
Aggressor, and the license rights under Section 2 shall be subject to suspension
as provided in Section 4 with respect to that entity.

4. DEFENSIVE SUSPENSION

If a Licensee (or any of its Affiliates) becomes an Aggressor by initiating or
maintaining a Patent Assertion against Licensor or any other implementer based on
a Conforming Implementation of OTAC 0.1.1, then, effective as of the date such
Patent Assertion is filed, all rights granted to that Aggressor under this
license shall automatically suspend for the duration of the Patent Assertion,
solely with respect to that Aggressor and its Affiliates.

The suspension described in this Section does not affect the rights of other
Licensees that are not Aggressors.

If the Aggressor permanently withdraws, dismisses, or finally resolves the Patent
Assertion without a finding of infringement against a Conforming Implementation,
the suspended rights under this license shall automatically be restored as of the
effective date of such withdrawal, dismissal, or final resolution.

For clarity, a counterclaim that is asserted solely in response to a prior patent
infringement lawsuit and that is not the first assertion of patent infringement
by the counterclaimant shall not, by itself, cause suspension under this Section.

5. SCOPE AND RESERVATIONS

This license:

(a) covers only Essential Claims that Licensor owns or controls at the time, and
only to the extent such claims are necessarily infringed by a Conforming
Implementation of OTAC 0.1.1;

(b) does not grant any rights in or to any trade secrets, copyrights,
trademarks, or other intellectual property rights of Licensor, except as
expressly stated;

(c) does not grant any rights with respect to other specifications, protocols,
or products that may be referenced in the OTAC 0.1.1 Specification as examples,
informative references, or optional integrations;

(d) does not obligate Licensor to disclose all patents or patent applications
that may be relevant to OTAC 0.1.1, nor to update or maintain the specification.

6. NO TRADEMARK RIGHTS; NO ENDORSEMENT

Nothing in this license grants any rights to use Licensor’s or NyxQuantum’s
names, logos, or trademarks, whether in connection with an implementation of
OTAC 0.1.1 or otherwise. Any such use requires a separate written agreement.

Use of the OTAC 0.1.1 Specification or this license does not imply endorsement,
certification, or compliance approval by Licensor or by NyxQuantum for any
product or implementation.

7. NO WARRANTY; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

THE OTAC 0.1.1 SPECIFICATION, THIS LICENSE, AND ANY RELATED MATERIALS ARE
PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING
IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE SPECIFICATION OR IMPLEMENTATION OF OTAC 0.1.1,
EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

8. CONTRIBUTIONS

By submitting any proposed change, clarification, test vector, code, or other
material to Licensor for possible inclusion in the OTAC 0.1.1 Specification or
its reference artifacts, the Contributor:

(a) represents that it has the necessary rights to make such submission, and

(b) grants to Licensor and to all Licensees a license, under Contributor’s
Essential Claims that would be necessarily infringed by implementing such
contribution as part of a Conforming Implementation, on the same FRAND-Z terms
as set out in Sections 2 and 3 above.

9. GOVERNING LAW; SEVERABILITY

Unless Licensor specifies otherwise in an accompanying notice, this license shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Spain, excluding its
conflict-of-law rules. Licensor may, for specific deployments or translations of
this license, designate another jurisdiction in a written notice accompanying
such deployment or translation.

If any provision of this license is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect, and the license shall
be interpreted so as to give maximum effect to the intent of the parties as
expressed herein.
